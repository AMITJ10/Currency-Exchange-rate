# Currency-Exchange-rate
 The Currency Exchange Rate App is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to convert currencies in real-time. It fetches the latest exchange rates from an API and displays the conversion based on user input. Users can select the source and target currencies, enter an amount, and instantly see the converted value.
